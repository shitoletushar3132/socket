io -> entire circuit
socket => specific client
- every socket has id which is unique
- emit use to emmit the message from client to server vise versa server to client
- if i emit(event1)  then by  on(event1)  i will catch that emitted data.

emit                    |
socket.emmit(ev1)       | socket.io(ev1)   => understand i emited on that ev1 that can be any name
socket.on(ev2)          | socket.emmit(ev1)   => understand i emited on that ev1 that can be any name


# socket.broadcast.emmit() 
 - msg will go to all except one who sent 
 - is a method that allows a server to send a message to all clients except the one that initiated the event. This is useful when you want to broadcast something to everyone, but exclude the sender from receiving the message.
